# DC50
Python script to process western blot data in generating a Degradation Constant (DC50) for Targeted Protein Degradation


The Hill Equation has four parameters:
I. Bottom: asymptote of curve at zero concentration
II. Top: asymptote of curve at max concentration
III. EC50 is 1/2 max
IV. nH: coefficient that reflects cooperativity of ligand binding
nH > 1 means positive cooperativity
nH = 1 means indpendent
nH < 1 means negative cooperativity
